Currently, my time is split between <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">EPFL</a> as a research assistant and educator at the lab of <a href="https://lcav.epfl.ch/martin.vetterli" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Vetterli</a> and <a href="https://snips.ai/" target="_blank">Snips</a> as a Tech Evangelist. I will join Snips full-time as a Signal Processing Scientist in January 2019.

<br />
I have enjoyed internships in the Silicon Valley (where I am originally from) with <a href="https://dspconcepts.com/" target="_blank">DSP Concepts</a> and in Germany (where I did my Bachelors) at <a href="https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en.html" target="_blank">Fraunhofer IDMT</a>.  

<br />
I am an applied mathematician and engineer, working in the domain of signal processing. I enjoy working with analytic models that can be intuitively grasped ;)

<br />
I love teaching and event organizing, which I have done extensively with [LauzHack](https://lauzhack.com/). Helping others have that "lightbulb" moment motivates me as an educator and researcher.
