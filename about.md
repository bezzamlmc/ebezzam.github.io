<!-- ***Here's*** a formal CV but more interestingly a [CV of failures]({{ site.url }}/pdfs/CV_failures.pdf). This idea started with Melanie Stefan's [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7322-467a) and got more attention when a Princeton professor posted [his CV of failures](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf). I think it's a great way of not only showing that everyone faces rejection but that the route to success is often accompanied with disappointment. The willingness to keep trying is a better reflection of our characterAnd that's a reflection of someone's determination and hard work.
