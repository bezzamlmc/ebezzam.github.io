Music is incredibly important for me! It's part of the reason I've dedicated a lot of my work to audio signal processing. Music and sound in general can have a profound effect on how we perceive the world around us. To music, I associate strong memories and sentiments. I enjoy listening to all genres (fusions are the best), meandering on the piano, and learning about music history and theory.

Below are some performances I did mostly during undergrad in Bremen, Germany. I would love to get back to performing so feel free to contact me if you want to jam :)

### Jacobs University Graduation 2015

Unfortunately, I started at half tempo :P so sorry for the rough start . The rest of the band eases in and the pace of the performance eventually picks up!

### The Jacobs Way Musical (backing band)

This was a lot of work (many rehearsals and three shows) but super fun! Props to Ali for putting all this together :)

### Spotlight 2015 (talent show)

We had a ton of fun with this performance, making a silly video of dancing on a BMW and working with the awesome dance crew at Jacobs!

### Art On! Battle of the Bands 2015 

The annual Battle of the Bands between the four colleges at Jacobs University. We were going for a really high energy set, I definitely got carried away with it! Sorry for the poor audio quality (I think it was filmed with a GoPro). We ended up winning for the second year in a row :)
