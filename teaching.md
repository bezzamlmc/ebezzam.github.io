### "Signal processing for communications" practical sessions (EPFL; Lausanne, Switzerland)

Practical sessions are being created to complement the theory taught in the course <a href="http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signal-processing-for-communications-COM-303" target="_blank">Signal processing for communications</a>. In particular, we go through the applications presented in this <a href="https://github.com/prandoni/COM303/blob/master/voice_transformer/voicetrans.ipynb" target="_blank">IPython notebook</a>. 

I am helping validate the implementations (mainly done by Adrien Hoffet) on the STM32 <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f072rb.html" target="_blank">Nucleo-F072</a> board and writing up the step-by-step guides for the students, most of whom are completely new to the world of embedded systems! Adrien and I will give the optional practical sessions together.

### Volunteer at <a href="https://girlscoding.org/" target="_blank">GirlsCoding</a> (Lausanne, Switzerland)

At LauzHack 2017 and at the Applied Machine Learning Days 2018, I volunteered in giving coding workshops to girls from ages 9-16. We even made it to the <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/girls-coding-on-rts/" target="_blank">Swiss national TV</a>!

### <a href="http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/audio-signal-processing-and-virtual-acoustics-COM-415" target="_blank">Audio signal processing and virtual acoustics</a> practical sessions (EPFL; Lausanne, Switzerland)

Coming back from my internship at DSP Concepts, I gave optional practical sessions on <a href="https://dspconcepts.com/solutions/audio-weaver" target="_blank">AudioWeaver</a> - a tool which significantly simplifies the process of designing and prototyping audio signal processing algorithms on embedded devices. For the tutorials, we used an <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f769idiscovery.html" target="_blank">STM32F7 discovery kit</a> by STMicroelectronics, and I gave interactive lessons on designing a passthrough, a single-channel noise removal, and a beamformer. Below are links to the slides/content:

### Assistant Instructor at the <a href="https://www.uwc-usa.org/page.cfm?p=864" target="_blank">Global Leadership Forum</a> 2012/2013 (Montezuma, NM, USA)

For two weeks in the summers of 2012 and 2013, I was one of the mentors in a global leadership camp for 30 youth from around 15 countries. We gave workshops in leadership, project development, community building, and intercultural experiences. This was combined with volunteer work at non-profits in Santa Fe and with a <a href="http://www.missionwolf.org/" target="_blank">Wolf Sanctuary</a> in Colorado.

### Breakthrough Collaborative Silicon Valley (Los Gatos, CA, USA)

Certainly one of my most favorite and memorable teaching experiences was with <a href="http://www.breakthroughsv.org/" target="_blank">Breakthrough Collorative Silicon Valley</a>. For eight weeks, I taught physics to very motivated 8th graders (~13 yo) students who came from low-performing schools and/or low-income backgrounds. Not only did this experience challenge me with designing a curriculum and preparing lesson plans to keep a classroom of teenagers focused and interested, but it also tested my character as I was called upon to be a role model for my students. As part of the program, the teachers were involved with several activities to help motivate the students to continue towards the path of college. I took a group of students to Santa Clara University and also shared my experiences of attending the United World College program.

This was definitely the _most_ gratifying teaching experience I have had.
