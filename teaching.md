Below are my various teaching experiences at nearly all levels of education. Each experience has had an impact on my public-speaking, communication, and leadership skills. Teaching at the university level has also played a strong part in reinforcing key concepts in signal processing!


### University

* **[Audio and acoustic signal processing](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/audio-and-acoustic-signal-processing-COM-415) (EPFL, Fall 2018)**<br>
For 2018, I am a full TA, which involves co-supervising mini-projects in:
    * Binaural room impulse response (RIR) generation
    * Noise reduction / speech enhancement
    * Modeling frequency dependence in RIR generation
    * Chorus effect
    * Pitch detection
    * Beat detection
    * Pitch shifting voice effects
    * Auto wah effect
    * Blind source separation
    * Parametric coding of stereo signals  
<br>

* **Semester project supervision (EPFL, 2016-now)**<br>
I've co-supervised the following projects with <a href="http://www.robinscheibler.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Robin Scheibler</a>:
    * (Fall 2016) Browser-based interface for microphone array processing in Python with the BeagleBone Black (BBB), [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LCAV/easy-dsp).
    * (Fall 2017) Using the PRU microcontrolles on the BBB for front-end audio processing (downsampling and low-pass filtering with the CIC filter) for an array of PDM microphones, [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Scrashdown/PRU-Audio-Processing).
    * (Spring 2018) Machine learning utilities, i.e. data augmentation and word classification with TensorFlow, for `pyroomacoustics`, [GitHub repo](https://github.com/alexismermet/pyroomacoustics/tree/master/examples/final_scripts_for_final).  
    * (Fall 2018) Ray-tracing techniques for room impulse response generation, [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CyrilCadoux/pyroomacoustics).  
<br>

* **[Signal processing for communications](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signal-processing-for-communications-COM-303) (EPFL, Spring 2018-now)**<br>
With [Adrien Hoffet](https://people.epfl.ch/adrien.hoffet?lang=fr&cvlang=fr) and the instructor [Paolo Prandoni](https://lcav.epfl.ch/people/paolo.prandoni), practical sessions with the [STM32 Nucleo-F072](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f072rb.html) were created to complement the theory taught in the course. In particular, we go through the voice transformations presented in this [IPython notebook](https://github.com/prandoni/COM303/blob/master/voice_transformer/voicetrans.ipynb) and port them for real-time implementation on the board with C. All the material for the practical exercises can be found [here](https://lcav.gitbook.io/dsp-labs/).

* **Audio signal processing and virtual acoustics (EPFL, Fall 2017)**<br>
I offered practical sessions on [AudioWeaver](https://dspconcepts.com/solutions/audio-weaver) - a tool which significantly simplifies the process of designing and prototyping audio signal processing algorithms on embedded devices. For the tutorials, we used an [STM32F7 discovery kit](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f769idiscovery.html), and I gave lessons on designing a passthrough, a single-channel noise removal component, and a beamformer. Below are links to the slides/content:

    * <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18sF4oqUtQeWtz_svH6a2cKl0DHXBqmJO?usp=sharing" target="_blank">STFT processing / Single-channel noise removal</a>

<br>
* **Jacobs University (2013-2015)**<br>
I was a TA for the following courses at Jacobs University, which involved giving tutorials, grading assignments and exams, and sometimes creating assignments.
    * DSP and Communications Laboratory (2nd year course).
    * Signals and Systems (2nd year course).
    * General Electrical Engineering (1st year course).


### Miscellaneous

* **[LauzHack Days](https://lauzhack.com/workshops) (Lausanne, 2018-now)**<br>
As part of [LauzHack](https://lauzhack.com/)'s mission enable hackers at EPFL, we began doing frequent workshops. I've given the following workshops:
    * [Hacking with Amazon Alexa](https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/build-with-alexa/)
    * [Fun Fourier Transform - Whistle Unlocker](https://github.com/ebezzam/melody-detection)       
<br>

* **[GirlsCoding](https://girlscoding.org/) volunteer (Switzerland, 2017-now)**<br>
On a few occasions, I have volunteered in giving coding workshops to girls of ages 9-16 in French and English:
    * [LauzHack 2017](http://girlscoding.org/event/lauzhack-mini/)
    * [Applied Machine Learning Days 2018](http://girlscoding.org/event/girlscoding-applied-machine-learning-days/), we even made it to <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/girls-coding-on-rts/" target="_blank">Swiss national TV</a>!
    * [Helvetic Coding Contest 2018](http://girlscoding.org/event/helvetic-coding-contest-mini/)
    * [Digital Days for Girls 2018](http://girlscoding.org/event/digital-days-4-girls/) (Swisscom event)  
    * [Girls Codeathon (Nov 10, 2018)](http://girlscoding.org/event/girls-codeathon/)    
<br>
* **Assistant instructor at the Global Leadership Forum (New Mexico, 2012 & 2013)**<br>
I was one of the mentors at the [Global Leadership Forum](https://www.uwc-usa.org/page.cfm?p=864) - a global leadership camp for 30 youth from around 15 countries. We gave workshops in leadership, project development, community building, and intercultural experiences. This was combined with volunteer work at non-profits in Santa Fe, New Mexico and with a [Wolf Sanctuary](http://www.missionwolf.org/) in Colorado.


* **Physics teacher with Breakthrough Collaborative Silicon Valley (California, 2011)**<br>
Certainly one of my most favorite and memorable teaching experiences was with <a href="http://www.breakthroughsv.org/" target="_blank">Breakthrough Collorative Silicon Valley</a>. For eight weeks, I taught physics to 8th graders (~13 yo) students who came from low-performing schools and/or low-income backgrounds. As part of the summer program, the teachers were involved with several activities to help motivate the students to continue towards the path of college. I took a group of students to Santa Clara University and also shared my experiences of attending the [United World College](https://www.uwc.org/) program.

* **Soccer (California, New Mexico, Germany)**<br>
During my youth, I was quite involved with [soccer](/blog/soccer-vs-football):
    * Captain for club teams in California: [MVLA](https://www.mvlasoccer.org/) and [De Anza Force](https://www.deanzaforce.org/).
    * Volunteer coach at the [Kick, lead, and Dream](http://www.kldsoccer.com/) summer camp in 2010.
    * Raised money and started team at UWC-USA in New Mexico. Co-captained team from 2011-2012.
    * At Jacobs University, captained team from 2014-2015, leading to highest ever league finish.  
<br>
* **Piano (New Mexico, 2011-2012)**<br>
I gave beginner piano lessons to the child of one of my teachers. I've taught countless people [Heart and Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF7-rz9nIn4) for quick jam sessions ;)
