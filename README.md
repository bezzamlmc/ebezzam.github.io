# Eric Bezzam's site

This site is based on the **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** theme, a two-column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

The theme and modications from Minimal Mistakes are adapted from [Jordi Pont-Tuset's site](https://github.com/jponttuset/jponttuset.github.io).
