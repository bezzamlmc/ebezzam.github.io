"Soccer" or "football"? As an American who loves _the beautiful game_, this question / debate often comes up.

<br>
From my experience, no matter what I say this conversation comes up. Either I say "soccer" and of course the European will say "why don't you call it football like everyone else!"; or I say "football" and they'll be confused which football I am refering to due to my American accent!

<br>
In the end, I typically stick to "soccer" as it was the [_original term_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football#Name) the British used for the sport and they "invented" it! Or maybe I'm just used to calling it soccer ;)
